    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p><strong>Childhood is Not For Sale.</strong> Across Africa, millions of children are being robbed of their childhood and forced into labor under harsh and dangerous conditions. From dawn till dusk, they toil in fields, mines, and workshops instead of attending school or playing with friends.</p>
    <p>This is a humanitarian crisis unfolding in plain sight – an estimated 92 million African children are trapped in child labor, the highest number of any region in the world. After years of progress, the situation is now worsening: in sub-Saharan Africa alone, child labor <strong>increased</strong> by 16.6 million in just four years, driven by extreme poverty and the impacts of conflicts and COVID-19. <strong>The urgency is real</strong> – each day of child labor is a day of lost education, lost innocence, and lost future.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Child labor refers to work that is mentally, physically, or morally harmful to children, or work that interferes with their education. It often involves boys and girls well below the minimum employment age toiling for long hours. In Africa, child labor is a complex problem rooted in deeper socio-economic issues. <strong>Poverty</strong> is the primary driving force – families in extreme poverty sometimes have no choice but to send their children to work just so the family can survive. When parents or caregivers are ill, unemployed, or absent, children become breadwinners out of necessity.</p>
    <p><strong>Lack of access to education</strong> is another major factor: in many areas, quality schooling is not free or not available, so children end up working because they have no school to attend. Economic instability and crises – from droughts and pandemics to armed conflicts – further exacerbate the situation by pushing more children out of classrooms and into labor. In sub-Saharan Africa, recurring crises, rapid population growth, and weak social safety nets have all contributed to the rise in child labor.</p>
    <p>Working from a young age <strong>deprives children of their basic rights and a chance at a better future</strong>. Most child laborers receive little to no education, leaving them illiterate or far behind their peers. The work itself is often hazardous: children may carry heavy loads, operate dangerous tools or machinery, and are exposed to chemicals and abuse. Such labor <strong>harms their physical and mental health</strong> – injuries, chronic illnesses, and trauma are common among child workers.</p>
    <p>International laws like <strong>ILO Convention 138</strong> (minimum age for employment), <strong>ILO Convention 182</strong> (worst forms of child labor), and the <strong>UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</strong> all prohibit exploitative child labor. Yet in many African communities, these rights exist only on paper. Weak law enforcement and entrenched economic hardships mean millions of children remain vulnerable to exploitation.</p>

    <h2>Statistics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> Over <strong>one in four children</strong> aged 5–17 in sub-Saharan Africa are in child labor — the highest rate globally.</li>
      <li><strong>Total Affected:</strong> Around <strong>92 million children</strong> in Africa are involved in child labor.</li>
      <li><strong>Industries:</strong> 70% in agriculture; 20% in services (e.g., domestic work, street vending); 10% in industry (e.g., mining, construction).</li>
      <li><strong>Regional Trends:</strong> Cocoa farming in West Africa, mining in Central Africa, and domestic labor in urban East Africa are key sectors of concern.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Help</h2>
    <p><strong>Support Child Rights Organizations:</strong> Donate or volunteer with organizations like <a href="https://www.unicef.org/" target="_blank">UNICEF</a>, <a href="https://www.worldvision.org/" target="_blank">World Vision</a>, and <a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/" target="_blank">Save the Children</a> to support education and rescue efforts.</p>
    <p><strong>Advocate for Policy Change:</strong> Push for stronger child protection laws, enforcement of international conventions, and ethical corporate supply chains.</p>
    <p><strong>Raise Awareness:</strong> Use social media, host events, or create campaigns to inform others. Share facts, personal stories, or host awareness events like on <strong>World Day Against Child Labour (June 12)</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Invest in Education and Livelihoods:</strong> Support scholarships, school supplies, and programs that empower families economically, reducing the need for child labor.</p>

    <p><strong>Together, we can break the cycle of exploitation.</strong> Every child deserves a safe and hopeful childhood, and with collective action, we can make that a reality.</p>
